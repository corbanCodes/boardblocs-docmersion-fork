                <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  A rural New Hampshire district, Contoocook Valley School District (ConVal) serves a broad community that has always valued education and transparency. With a 13-member school board working in conjunction with the New Hampshire School Board Association, the district manages nearly 450 policies that must be constantly updated in response to legislative changes.
                </p>
                <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-6 py-2 my-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-r-xl">
                  <p class="text-slate-700 italic leading-relaxed">
                    "Communication has always been key. There are about 400 to 450 school board policies that need to be tracked and updated in response to legislative changes, most recently that apply to the statewide ban on smartphones in schools during school hours, and the use of generative AI."

                </blockquote>
                <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
                  For years, ConVal's policies lived as static PDFs buried deep within the district website. This made them difficult to search, hard to keep updated, and nearly impossible for families who weren't fluent in English. Some, like the 27-page discipline policy, could be overwhelming even for native speakers.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                  Without translation tools, staff often had to prepare entire policy packets by hand—a process that was time-consuming, inconsistent, and unsustainable.
                </p>
              </div>
              
              <!-- From Paper Packets to Instant Access -->

                <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-extrabold text-slate-900 mb-6">From Paper Packets to Instant Access</h2>
                <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  When ConVal came to BoardBlocs with this issue, they found a solution that transformed the way policies were published and shared—DocMersion.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Instead of being locked in PDFs, DocMersion by BoardBlocs enables policies to live directly on the district website where they are searchable, up to date, and instantly translatable into multiple languages.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  To bring ConVal onboard with DocMersion, BoardBlocs met with their team to review their document portfolio and learn more about their district, schools and specific needs. After gathering the large portfolio of documents, the BoardBlocs team went to work on setup and implementation, delivering white-glove service so ConVal was up and running with DocMersion quickly and confidently.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
                  From setup to launch to customization, BoardBlocs partnered with ConVal every step of the way—tailoring DocMersion to their needs, answering questions, and ensuring a smooth rollout with support that continues today.

                <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  With DocMersion by BoardBlocs in place, the district no longer has to spend hours reprinting or preparing policy packets by hand. Visitors to the website can now search policies quickly and even discover related ones, making it easier to understand how the district's policies connect and overlap.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Every update is reflected online immediately, ensuring families always have access to the most accurate version. Perhaps most importantly, parents can now read these policies in their native languages, creating a more inclusive experience and strengthening trust between the district and its community.

                <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Another benefit of DocMersion, Zrzavy explains, is the ability to uncover related policies during a search. In the past, users had to know exactly what to type in to find what they needed. Now, not only can they quickly locate a specific policy, but they can also see other policies connected to the same issue.

                  As new legislation and technology continue to reshape education, ConVal now feels equipped to keep pace. Instead of scrambling to distribute new policies, the district can now respond quickly and confidently.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
                  Whether it's the introduction of AI guidelines, statewide device restrictions, or future policies yet to emerge, ConVal can ensure that families, staff, and the broader community are informed in real time. Things change quickly in education. Backed by DocMersion, ConVal isn't just keeping up with change—they're ready for whatever comes next.
